GERBERs:

Open the CAM Processor - click “File->Open->Job…”

Browse to your …/eagle/cam/ folder, and you should see a file called gerb274x.cam. Choose it and click “Open”.

You will now see five tabs in the CAM Processor. Each of these tabs will generate a Gerber file.

Open it in the CAM Processor by clicking “File->Open->Job…”

Drill:

Browse to your …/eagle/cam/ folder, and open the file named “excellon.cam”.

-----------------------------------------

Eagle copy library parts:

Use the command line. With the target library open, enter:
   copy devicename.dev@sourcelib  (enter appropriate names here)
Use the control panel. With the target library open, switch to the
   control panel, open the source library there, select the device with
   the right mouse button and chose "copy to library".

Increase the clearance cut width: right click on the flood polygon; properties; isolation width.

Position PCB near origin

NB bottom does not need to be mirrored to cut correctly.  But X=0 is then to the right of the PCB.

As above.

Adjust Z0 at (x,y)=(0,0) then do G92 X0 Y0 Z0

NB!!! Set spindle spinning before executing G Code: M3 S1, then move Z +1mm

Use Eagle CAD DRC to Enforce Design Limitations
1. In Eagle CAD, select 'Tools->DRC->Clearance'
2. Set all of the 'Different Signals' clearances to a value larger than your engraving tool (12mil seems to work for a Zen Toolworks 30deg V-Bit)
3. If you already have a board designed, select 'Check' to see what parts of your board may be too close together to isolate
Step 3: Make G-Code for a Board

Use pcb-gcode to generate G-Code from Eagle CAD
1. Open your board design in Eagle CAD
2. From the Eagle CAD Control Panel window, right-click User Language Programs->pcb-gcode->pcb-gcode-setup.ulp and select 'Run In Board'
3. The pcb-gcode dialog will pop up.
4. On the 'Generation Options' tab, select 'Generate bottom outlines', 'Generate bottom drills' and 'Show preview'.
5. For 'Etching Tool Size' enter 0.254mm
6. On the 'Machine' tab, set 'Spindle Up Time' to 3 and set the feed rates to 300mm/min
7. Set 'Z High' to 12mm, 'Z Up' to 3mm, 'Z Down' to -0.08mm
8. Use calipers to determine the thickness of your board and enter that value plus .1mm or so for 'Drill Depth'
9. On the 'GCode Style' tab, select 'Mach3 - EMC for Windows'
10. On the 'GCode Options' tab, select all of the 'NC File Comments' options as well as 'Do tool change with zero step'
11. Click 'Accept and make my board'
12. An image view window will pop up and display what will be etched. pcb-gcode will join signals that are too close so look at the image carefully to make sure that all signals are properly isolated.

Use pcb-probe to generate leveling G-Code for your board G-Code
13. From your favorite command shell, navigate to the directory where your Eagle CAD board files are saved.
14. Look for some files that end with '.tap'. Those are the G-Code files you generated with pcb-gcode
15. Find a file named (something).etch.tap. That is the G-Code for etching your design.
16. Run pcb-probe on that file by typing 'pcb-probe (something).etch.tap (something).probe.tap
17. You should see something like this:

Processing input file ... pov_driver.bot.etch.tap
Board Size (mm): 47.5488x32.3088

Generating Mach3 GCode output in pov_driver.bot.probe.tap
Done.
